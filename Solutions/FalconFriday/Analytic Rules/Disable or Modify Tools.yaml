  This detection watches the commandline logs for known commands that are used to disable the Defender AV. This is based on research performed by @olafhartong on a large sample of malware for varying purposes. 
  Note that this detection is imperfect and is only meant to serve as basis for building a more resilient detection rule. 
  Some software behaves weirdly, we've at least identified that JetBrains and Android Studio are behaving oddly. Not sure why, yet. Perhaps I should stop using JetBrains?
  Make the detection more resilient, currently the order of parameters matters. You don't want that for a production rule. See blogpost for more resilience considerations.
  The current approach can easily be bypassed by not using the powershell.exe executable. Consider adding more ways to detect this behavior.
